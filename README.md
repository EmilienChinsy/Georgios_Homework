# Georgios Homework

This is an assignement given to us over the weekend,
it's about simple data handling in c++

The requirements for this assignement are:

1. Build a data type of your choice (class, struct), to represent one real-world set of entitie. (e.g. Students, Cars, Products, etc.). Think of appropriate attributes in each case (e.g. year of enrolment, name, etc.)
2. Create instances/objects of your data type and store them in a Data Structure of your choice

   (e.g. list, vector, BST). Optimally, the data structure should follow your own implementation. Data can be randomly generated.
3. Implement addition, retrieval, updating and removal functionalities, through a simple console menu.
4. Implement a version of Merge Sort, to sort your data structure based on a "sortable" attribute (e.g. year of enrolment, name)
5. Support any function that depends on search (retrieval, updating and removal), with your implementation of Binary Search (or, optionally, a suitable tree structure).

Maintain a public remote repository on GitHub, with just the necessary documentation on how to build and run your code.

Include a short description about what your project does and what limitations it may have (bugs, unfinished tasks, etc.).

To run the program: 

1. Clone the repository `git clone https://github.com/EmilienChinsy/Georgios_Homework
2. Locate and navigate to the location of the now local repository cd Georgios_Homework
3. Compile the program using `g++ main.cpp -o main.o`
4. execute the program using ./main.o
